# Optimization of marketing costs

### Task description

The goal of this project is to help an e-commerce company to analyze how customers use the product when they start to purchase, average revenue and payback period. The company needs to decide how much and in what advert resources they need to invest.

### Project decription

In that project I’ve calculated some of the key product and marketing metrics such as DAU, WAU, MAU, Retention Rate, CAC, LTV, ROMI. I also visualized them for presentation purposes. As a result, I could advise the company how much and in what advert resources they need to invest. For that project I’ve used python (pandas, numpy) to clean data and calculate the metrics and plotly, seaborn and matplotlib to visualize them.


### Data description

In that project I had the following information:
- visits
