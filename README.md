# Data analitics projects

This repository is for my favourite projects that I've done during the study data analysis at Yandex.Praktikum.

Yandex.Praktikum's Data Analyst program prepared me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, to get insights from data, draw meaningful conclusions and visualize information in the best way. I've developed proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scipy) and improved my SQL skills as I build a portfolio of projects.
